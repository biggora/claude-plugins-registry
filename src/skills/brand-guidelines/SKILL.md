Also use when the user provides brand assets (colors, logos, fonts) and wants them organized into a cohesive document.

## Modes

Determine the mode from the user's input:

**Express** — User provides brand assets upfront ("Here are my colors: #2563EB, #1E293B; font: Inter; brand name: Acme"). Validate inputs, fill gaps with smart defaults, confirm, generate.

**Guided** — User has some ideas but needs structure ("I want a brand guide for my SaaS startup"). Run the full 6-stage interview with suggestions.

**Discovery** — User starts from scratch ("Help me create a brand identity"). Start from personality/values, derive palette and typography suggestions, then proceed through all stages.

---

## Brand Interview Protocol

Present questions in batches by stage — not one at a time. Allow "skip" or "default" for any stage. After all stages, present a confirmation summary before generating.

### Stage 1: Brand Identity (required)

```
Brand name:
Tagline / slogan (optional):
Industry / domain:
Brand personality (3-5 adjectives, e.g. bold, friendly, minimal):
```

### Stage 2: Color Palette

```
Primary color (hex or describe, e.g. "deep blue"):
Secondary color:
Accent color(s):
Background light:
Background dark:
Semantic colors — success / warning / error / info (or "default"):
```

If user provides personality adjectives but no colors, generate 2-3 palette suggestions. Read `references/brand-interview-guide.md` for the personality-to-palette algorithm and industry defaults.

**Palette suggestion format:**
```
Based on "[adjectives]", here are three palette options:

Option A (name): Primary #XXXXXX, Secondary #XXXXXX, Accent #XXXXXX
Option B (name): Primary #XXXXXX, Secondary #XXXXXX, Accent #XXXXXX
Option C (name): Primary #XXXXXX, Secondary #XXXXXX, Accent #XXXXXX

Which resonates most? You can also mix and adjust.
```

### Stage 3: Typography

```
Heading font (e.g. Inter, Poppins):
Body text font:
Monospace font (optional, for code/technical content):
Font weights (e.g. 400, 600, 700):
```

If user has no font preference, recommend based on brand personality. Read `references/brand-interview-guide.md` for font pairing recommendations.

### Stage 4: Logo & Imagery

```
Logo file path(s) (if available on disk):
Logo minimum size:
Logo clear space rule:
Prohibited logo alterations:
Photography / illustration style:
Icon style (outlined, filled, duotone):
```

If user provides a logo file, read it and embed as base64 data URI in the HTML. If no logo exists, create a placeholder section with "Logo TBD" and document the usage rules for when a logo is added.

### Stage 5: Voice & Tone

```
Communication style (formal / casual / technical / friendly):
Words to use:
Words to avoid:
Example sentences for different contexts (marketing, support, technical):
```

### Stage 6: Spacing & Layout

```
Base spacing unit (default: 8px):
Spacing scale (default: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64):
Border radius (default: 4px, 8px, 12px):
Shadow / elevation style:
```

### Minimum Viable Input

The absolute minimum to generate a brand book:
- Brand name
- 1 primary color
- 1 font choice

Everything else gets smart defaults. Always inform the user what defaults were applied.

## Smart Defaults by Industry

When user provides industry but skips color/font choices, use these as starting suggestions:

| Industry | Palette Direction | Font Pairing | Tone |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|------|
| Technology | Blue/slate tones | Inter / System UI, sans-serif | Clean, direct |
| Healthcare | Blue-green/teal | Nunito Sans / clean serif | Calm, trustworthy |
| Finance | Navy / gold | Playfair Display + Source Sans | Formal, authoritative |
| Food & Beverage | Warm earth tones | Rounded sans (Nunito, Quicksand) | Friendly, appetizing |
| Creative / Design | Bold / unexpected | Display + geometric sans | Playful, expressive |
| Education | Blue / green | Readable sans (Open Sans, Lato) | Approachable, clear |
| Luxury | Black / gold / white | Elegant serif (Cormorant, Libre Baskerville) | Refined, exclusive |
| Nonprofit | Earth tones / hopeful | Humanist sans (Source Sans, Fira Sans) | Warm, inspiring |
| E-commerce | Vibrant accent + neutral | Modern sans (Inter, DM Sans) | Persuasive, clear |
| Legal | Dark blue / charcoal | Traditional serif (Merriweather) | Formal, precise |

Read `references/brand-interview-guide.md` for expanded personality-to-palette mappings.

## Confirmation Summary

Before generating, present a formatted summary of all collected brand data:

```
## Brand Book Summary — [Brand Name]

**Identity**: [name] — "[tagline]"
**Personality**: [adjective1], [adjective2], [adjective3]

**Colors**:
- Primary: [swatch] #XXXXXX "[name]"
- Secondary: [swatch] #XXXXXX "[name]"
- Accent: [swatch] #XXXXXX "[name]"

**Typography**:
- Headings: [font] ([weights])
- Body: [font] ([weights])

**Logo**: [provided / placeholder]
**Voice**: [style summary]
**Spacing base**: [N]px

Defaults applied: [list any auto-filled values]

Shall I generate the brand book with these settings?
```

---

## HTML Brand Book Generation

Read `references/html-brand-book-template.md` for the complete HTML/CSS template.

### Structure of the Output File

The generated `brand-guidelines.html` file contains:

1. **Cover Page** — Brand name, tagline, generation date, personality keywords
2. **Table of Contents** — Clickable anchor links to each section
3. **Color Palette** — Visual swatches with hex / RGB / HSL values, contrast ratio badges (WCAG AA/AAA), light & dark mode palettes
4. **Typography** — Live font specimens at each scale level (H1-caption), weight demonstrations, line height and letter spacing
5. **Logo Usage** — Logo display (base64 embedded or placeholder), minimum size, clear space diagram, do's and don'ts grid
6. **Voice & Tone** — Style description, word choice guidance, example copy in 3 contexts
7. **Spacing & Layout** — Spacing scale visualization, border radius specimens, shadow elevation examples
8. **Component Examples** — Buttons (primary/secondary/ghost), cards, form inputs, alerts styled to brand
9. **Quick Reference Card** — One-page summary of all key values (copy-paste friendly hex codes, font names, spacing values)

### Technical Requirements

- **Self-contained**: All CSS inline in `<style>`, no external stylesheets
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts via `<link>` tags in `<head>`, with CSS fallback stacks for offline
- **Logo**: Embedded as base64 `data:` URI in `<img>` tag, or SVG inline
- **Colors**: Rendered as CSS background-color divs, not images
- **Contrast**: Small inline JS function (~20 lines) calculating WCAG luminance ratio, showing AA/AAA badges
- **Print**: `@media print` rules — page breaks between sections, hide interactive elements
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile viewports
- **Size**: ~800-1500 lines depending on brand complexity

Read `references/brand-book-sections.md` for detailed content standards per section.

### Output Path

- Default: `./brand-guidelines.html` in current working directory
- Multi-brand projects: `./brand-guidelines-{brandname}.html`
- After generation, report the file path to the user

---

## Logo Handling

If user provides a logo file path:
1. Read the file using the Read tool
2. For SVG: embed inline in the HTML
3. For PNG/JPG: base64 encode and embed as `data:image/png;base64,...`
4. Display in the Logo Usage section with clear space visualization

If no logo file:
1. Create a text-based placeholder using brand name + primary color
2. Document logo usage rules with placeholder area
3. Add note: "Replace placeholder with final logo"

---

## Pitfalls to Avoid

- Never generate brand colors without user confirmation — always present options and ask
- Always calculate and display contrast ratios for text-on-background combinations
- Warn if selected fonts are not available on Google Fonts (offline viewing impact)
- Never hardcode any specific company's brand values — this is a universal skill
- Do not try to generate logos, create social media templates, or design systems — output is one HTML brand book document
- When embedding logo images, verify the file exists before reading
- Always apply consistent naming to colors (give each color a semantic name)
